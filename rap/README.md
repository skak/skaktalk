_I'm_ learning how to write markdown!
Surrounding things in underscores makes them have a gangster lean!
Two asterisks and **I'll shine on you hoes!**
No, really it's just bold, that's how she goes.
Leaning and shining? **_NO PROBLEM!_**
Accomplished by two stars, followed by an underscore, and then repeated in reverse!
Ohhhh what's this???
Headers are declared with pound signs!
# Header one
## Header two
### Header three
#### Header four
The difference is in the root symbol! Woop woop!

I guess I'm learning about searching now... or linking rather. Well, that's important.

Hey, neat!
Apparently you can mod your link text too
